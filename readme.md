# CSE 440 Assignments Repository

### This repository is for storing programming assignments done in ***Artificial Intelligence*** *(CSE 440)* intro course by ***[me](https://github.com/AsifulNobel)*** in Summer of 2016 at North South University.

Each assignment
is stored in sub-directories named by the order (**e.g.** 1, 2, 3 etc.) those were given by the course instructor. Each sub-directory contains *assignment problem statements* in *pdf* file and sample inputs in *.txt* files. The sub-directories also contain my solutions to these problems in **Python**.
