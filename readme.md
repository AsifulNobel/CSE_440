#CSE 440 Assignments Repository

###This repository is for storing programming assignments done in ***Artificial Intelligence*** *(CSE 440)* intro course by ***[me](https://github.com/AsifulNobel)*** in Summer of 2016 at North South University.

Each assignment
is stored in sub-directories named by the order (**e.g.** 1, 2, 3 etc.) those were given by the course instructor. Each sub-directory contains *assignment problem statements* in *pdf* file and sample inputs in *.txt* files. The sub-directories also contain my solutions to these problems in **Python**.

##Assignments Summary
* Implemented an uninformed search algorithm(Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm) to find shortest route between two cities
* Implemented an agent that can play Max-Connect4 game using depth-limited version of Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
* Implemented inference engine for a game wumpus world which can infer if a given statement is definitely true, definitely false, possibly true or false, both true and false using constructed knowledge base
* Implemented optimized decision tree, randomized decision tree and randomized decision forest for 3 & 15 trees
